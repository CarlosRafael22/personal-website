In this year's goal to focus on making a real impact, I've started working with my sister, an architect specialized in neuroarchitecture, to drive real results for her business.

This has been an opportunity to explore beyond day-to-day engineering, diving into product thinking, UX, and business. It's also been a way to test ideas and grow other skills I want to develop with a long-term vision.

Therefore, plenty of work has been done, and more is coming:

I'm excited to share that after a few weeks of coding, strategy sessions, and aligning on goals, the first version of her website is now live: [https://therezaoliveira.com](https://therezaoliveira.com) ðŸŽ‰

Throughout the process, I tried to understand her vision and combined it with some best practices to shape how we present her work in a way that feels both authentic and strategic.

With that, we want to:

â†’ Give her business a more professional digital presence

â†’ Set her apart from other architects, focusing on her approach

â†’ Make the site the core of a lead capture and qualification funnel

This is just the initial version, and we're already working on what's next:

â†’ Implementing tracking tools to gather insights

â†’ Designing a lead qualification questionnaire

â†’ Building a simple dashboard to manage leads and projects

â†’ Refining copy and design for better clarity and conversion

Beyond that, we'll keep working on different areas to shape her business and strengthen her online presence and internal processes to deliver real value.

The journey so far has been exciting. I'll keep posting updates and how I'm doing it (yes, I've teamed up with AI).

For now, if you're curious, check out the website. There's more to come, stay tuned :)

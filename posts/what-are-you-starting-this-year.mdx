At the beginning of 2024, I had one of those rare, insightful moments that shifted how I see myself professionally. I realised I’m a Product Engineer—an engineer who builds with empathy towards users, cares deeply about solving their problems, and thinks beyond just writing great software.

This year, I want to be bolder. I want to explore my interests more intentionally, dive deeper into them, and put my knowledge into action.

Having co-founded a startup in the past, I was exposed to different sides of product development, which sparked many of these interests. Since moving to Munich, I’ve been working as a Frontend Engineer and enjoying it. However, I know my passion extends beyond coding and my entrepreneurial mindset is still very much alive.

I have skills and interests in product and UX/UI, but I can only do so much to develop them in my daily work. I knew I needed to take a different approach in my spare time, yet I hadn't truly prioritised it.

That changes in 2025.

Even with just a rough sketch, I decided to stop overthinking, get things off the drawing board, and put them into action.

That’s why I created thi personal website.

I want this space to be a place where I learn, practice, and share my thoughts, doubts, findings, and journey. There’s still a lot to improve, but taking the first step was the most important part.

With this, I’m starting the year by already checking off one goal for 2025, and I plan to keep that momentum going throughout the year.

What about you? What are you finally taking off the drawing board? What are you starting this year?

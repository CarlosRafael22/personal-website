In a tech environment, we all know what a "Hello, world" means. It's the simplest piece of code to illustrate a language's basic syntax.
It's kind of the first thing you write in a new language you're learning. When you see a "Hello, world" tutorial, you know that it will your first steps
in a new path you will try to pursue.

In this sense, I am writing this post. Not to be a guide on how to build personal websites (there are plenty of non-"Hello, world" tutorial for that),
but to be my first post in this new journey, bringing a short summary on how it was built.

And there was only two steps: design and development.

# Design step

As with every personal project I start, my first step is to design on Figma. This is a tool I'm familiarised with and want to develop more skills
on. So whenever I can, I use it to learn a bit more.

I wanted to do something uncomplicated, not to spend so much time in ideation. I got some inspiration and designed a simple layout for the Home and Blog pages.
Usually I design different variations until I'm satisfied with the result (or at least until my "design battery" runs out), but for this I avoided that.

In the end, I created some Figma components (to be easier to modify things and to help me translate them into React components), a Home page, 
a Blog page, and left a possible future iteration unfinished:

With that done, I could bring the next concern: **how should I code that?**

# Development step

## Creating the home and article pages

Differently from my last attempt to create a personal website, where I started from scratch with Chakra-UI, this time **I knew from the start that
I'd like to use a template to speed up the process**.

My focus is not on crafting an amazing website to be used as a portfolio and code every detail. My goal with this website is to be able to finally focus on writing about my interests and share things I learned. Along the way, of course I want to
work with some new tech and try cool stuff out but that's not the main goal.

With that in mind, **I had another "requirement": to use AI to help me do things faster**. For that, I already knew the tool: [Vercel's v0](https://v0.dev/).

I've been using it sporadically in some smaller projects I and I really liked it. Previously, I created some pages directly from prompts
without using any base design and it really give us our "v0".

You still need to modify the code: remove static data and make it as props, refactor some components, create new ones, and adapt things to suit your way of building things. However, it provides a really good starting point.

So turning the design into code was as fast as:
- taking a screenshot of the UI
- writing a prompt
- hitting enter
- waiting some seconds to see what it generated

(And it could be even shorter since I've noticed that it has an "import from Figma" option now)

It didn't implemented exactly how I designed, but it added actually some nice changes that I ended up taking.

## Finding a template

With the Home and Article pages in a "v0" state, I started looking for a good template to use.

It took more time than I was initially expecting but in the end I think I found a good base.

I had some requirements: Next.js, Typescript, Storybook, Tailwind CSS and Testing Library were the bare minimum for me. The more configured
the merrier. After searching for templates on [Next.js website](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js) and some others, I finally decided for 
[Next.js Boilerplate](https://nextjs-boilerplate.com/) from [@ixartz](https://github.com/ixartz).

It had a lot of libraries integrated out-of-the-box so I wouldn't need to worry about it. Because of that, it will be also nice to look at some
 tech that I haven't explored and learn new things. In the end, if it has too much, I can always remove things in the future.

## Setting the blog with MDX

After getting the code generated by v0 and placing it somewhere in the project structure, I started refactoring some code and creating more components.
At this stage, things are still messy in the components folder.

Usually in personal projects I create components based on [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).
However, this time I just started creating them with no defined structure yet. Since there were only a few, there's no problem. But I'll revisit that (more on Next steps part).

After creating some basic components for both Home and Article pages, I focused on how to actually bring the articles to life.

Back in 2021, when I first created my "personal website", for the blog I opted to use a Headless CMS. This time, I went for a simpler way: MDX.

You can get more context [here](https://mdxjs.com/), but basically it lets you use JSX in markdown content. In the first posts, I will just probably
use normal markdown. In the future, however, I want to add more stuff in the articles, so it made sense to me.

To set things up, among other things, this [tutorial from Colby Fayock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsSUAOkepCw) and [another by Next.js own documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/pages-router/dynamic-routes-render-markdown)
were very helpful.

And it basically went like it always goes: follow tutorial, struggle with things not working as expected, find a way around, be happy with things kind of working, try to refactor, kind of break things,
understand what was missing, and make it great again. At last, create a mental ticket for cleaning up the mess you made.

You can insert any personal pronoum as subject there: I, you, he, she, they and we have **all** been through that. And now it even works with **it**. AI can go through that as well... maybe skipping some steps.

For how the blog itself works, I plan to write more about it, but the main library I used was `next-mdx-remote`.

## Next steps

There are a lot of things to polish to leave the project in a "decent" state, but as they say in the startup world: ‚ÄúIf you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product,
you‚Äôve launched too late.‚Äù - [quote by Reid Hoffman](https://x.com/reidhoffman/status/847142924240379904).

So I had the same mindset, and decided to just deploy this version
with what I've done so far. Functionality-wise, it's kind of how it should be... code-wise, aaah not close!

To fix that, I want to:
- Get ride of unused code, refactor other snippets
- Write unit tests and possibly my first tests with Playwright for the current experience
- Define a structure for the components folder (probably Atomic Design again)

## Conclusion

That's it! That's the post! If you've made it so far... congratulations! üëè

There was no AI involved in the writing of this article, nor checks on Grammarly or feedback given. Just plain old-school typing words that came to mind while listening to some music
to make it more manageable.

Pro tip: next time try to vibe to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YklX6sHIeQ) to make it more enjoyable üòâ

And so, after all this post, I leave you my `Hello, world`.
